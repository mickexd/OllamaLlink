# OllamaLlink

This Python script is designed to facilitate the process of adding LLM (Language Model) files to Ollama.

## Dependencies

- `flet`: This script utilizes the `flet` library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs) in Python. Make sure to install this library before running the script.

## Usage

1. Ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed, particularly the `flet` library.
2. Run the script using a Python interpreter.
3. The script will open a GUI window where you can interact with the interface.
4. Follow the prompts in the GUI to select an LLM GGUF model file and enter the LLM name.
5. Click on the "Add LLM to Ollama" button to initiate the process of adding the LLM to Ollama.
6. Depending on the outcome of the operation, you will receive a success or error message via a dialog box in the GUI.

## How It Works

- The script utilizes the `flet` library to create a GUI window with various interactive elements.
- Users can select an LLM GGUF model file and specify the name of the LLM to be added to Ollama.
- Upon clicking the "Add LLM to Ollama" button, the script executes a command to add the specified LLM to Ollama.
- Success and error messages are displayed to the user based on the outcome of the operation.
